# Employee resignation prediction
# Summary

![](visuals/dist_feature.png)

* Created a tool that predicts when an employee is going to resign in order to help perfect employee management and improve working space environment.
* Based on the public release data available on Kaggle, the features are employed.
* Engineered features to calculate dependencies of the target variable on the independent variables.
* Optimized Logistic, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classifier using GridSearchCV to reach best model.
* Achieved an accuracy of 90.62% in correctly predicting the outcome.

Getting to understand employees is a major task in any successful organization. Various factors combine enough to create a snowball effect in the minds of employee on whether he/she sees the future of oneself in their current working environment.

Some of the major factors include Salary, Satisfaction level, promotion, average working hours, etcâ€¦ By correlating the different features we can arrive on a decision based on the prediction. Since the output here is whether the employee leaves or not therefore it is termed as a classification problem.

A classification model attempts to draw some conclusion from observed values. Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to predict the value of one or more outcomes.

Popular algorithms that can be used for binary classification include:

1. Logistic Regression
2. k-Nearest Neighbors
3. Decision Trees
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Naive Bayes

By employing the GridSearchCV on the above classifying algorithms we conclude-

Decision Tree classifier to be optimum with 90.62% accuracy
