# Employee resignation prediction

# Summary
* Created a tool that predicts when an employee is going to resign in order to help perfect employee management and improve working space environment.
* Based on the public release data available on Kaggle, the features are employed.
* Engineered features to calculate dependencies of the target variable on the independent variables.
* Optimized Logistic, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Support vector classifier using GridSearchCV to reach best model.
* Achieved an accuracy of 95% in correctly predicting the outcome.
* Developed a public facing API for live user interaction using Streamlit imported as library.
* Deployed the Web App based on cloud application platform as a service through Heroku.


Getting to understand employees is a major task in any successful organization. Various factors combine enough to create a snowball effect in the minds of employee on whether he/she sees the future of oneself in their current working environment.

Some of the major factors include Salary, Satisfaction level, promotion, average working hours, etcâ€¦ By correlating the different features we can arrive on a decision based on the prediction. Since the output here is whether the employee leaves or not therefore it is termed as a classification problem.


# Dataset

This dataset consists of <details>
  <summary>Features
</summary>


- Satisfaction Level
- Last Evaluation
- Number of Projects
- Average Monthly hours of work
- Time in the company
- Work_accidentleft
- Promotion in last 5 years
- Department
- Salary range
</details>

# Data Distribution

* Plotting the data points lets us understand the distribution
* Helps in deriving trends and draw conclusion
* Indicates the features that needs preprocessing

* Features like Satisfaction level, Monthly hours and Last evaluation shows normal distribution.
* The target variable 'Left' tells whether an employee is quitting or not.
* Value '1' indicated resignation whereas '0' implies employee is likely to stay.
* Before the preprocessing the data, the imbalance of the dataset needs to be handeled.

# Preprocessing

* It consisted of 3 major parts:
1. Handling class imbalance
* It is done using [SMOTE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-handling-imbalanced-data-with-smote-and-near-miss-algorithm-in-python/)
2. Handling non numerical features
* Achieved with help of Dummy variables created with Pandas get_dummy function
3. Scaling the features
* Sklearn's preprocessing library contains Standard Scalar which scales the data points with help of mean and standard deviation of the data.

* A classification model attempts to draw some conclusion from observed values. Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to predict the value of one or more outcomes.
* Popular algorithms that can be used for binary classification include:

1. Logistic Regression
2. k-Nearest Neighbors
3. Decision Trees
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Naive Bayes

By employing the GridSearchCV on the above classifying algorithms we conclude-

SVC of support vector machine to be optimum with 95% accuracy

# User Interface

* Creating a user interface lets new users to visualize practical application of a machine learning model. 
* This WebApp is based on open source app framework called Streamlit.
* More about this framework [Here](https://streamlit.io/)
* Here is demo of the API
