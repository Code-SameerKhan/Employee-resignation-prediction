# Employee resignation prediction
An introduction to logistic regression machine learning algorithm.
It is applicable on categorical data and determines the target in the form of binary form, eg- (1/0),(yes/no)
Data is fit into linear regression model, which then be acted upon by a logistic function predicting the target categorical dependent variable.
In this case we have to consider various independent variables that may or may not contribute towards quiting of an employee.
Since the target or the variable to predicted is in category form (yes/no), logistic regression algorithm is applied
